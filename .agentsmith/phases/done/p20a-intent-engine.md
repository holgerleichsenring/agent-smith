# Phase 20a: Intent Engine — Regex + Haiku + Project Resolution

## Goal

Replace the current `RegexIntentParser` with a robust two-stage Intent Engine
that understands free-form natural language input while keeping costs minimal
and behaviour deterministic for known patterns.

A third stage handles project resolution without AI — purely by querying
configured ticket providers.

---

## Design Principles

- **Free first:** Regex catches ~90% of real inputs at zero cost
- **Cheap second:** Claude Haiku only for inputs that don't match Regex
- **Deterministic third:** Project lookup is explicit code, never AI
- **Always structured output:** Every stage produces the same JSON shape
- **Graceful degradation:** Unknown intent → helpful response, never silent failure

---

## Output Schema (all stages produce this)

```json
{
  "commandType": "fix | list | create | help | unknown",
  "ticketNumber": "58",
  "project": "agent-smith-test",
  "title": "",
  "confidence": "high | low"
}
```

- `commandType`: what the user wants to do
- `ticketNumber`: numeric ticket ID (empty string if not applicable)
- `project`: project name from config (empty string if not specified)
- `title`: ticket title for `create` command (empty string otherwise)
- `confidence`: `high` = certain, `low` = Haiku guessed, may need clarification

---

## Stage 1: Regex Pre-Filter (zero cost)

Handles all common patterns directly. Runs before any AI call.

### Patterns

```
fix #58                          → { commandType:"fix", ticket:"58", project:"" }
fix #58 in agent-smith-test      → { commandType:"fix", ticket:"58", project:"agent-smith-test" }
fix ticket #58                   → { commandType:"fix", ticket:"58", project:"" }
fix ticket #58 in xyz            → { commandType:"fix", ticket:"58", project:"xyz" }
ticket #58                       → { commandType:"fix", ticket:"58", project:"" }

list tickets                     → { commandType:"list", project:"" }
list tickets in agent-smith-test → { commandType:"list", project:"agent-smith-test" }
list                             → { commandType:"list", project:"" }

create ticket "Add logging" in xyz        → { commandType:"create", title:"Add logging", project:"xyz" }
create "Add logging" in xyz               → { commandType:"create", title:"Add logging", project:"xyz" }

help                             → { commandType:"help" }
?                                → { commandType:"help" }
what can you do                  → { commandType:"help" }
```

All regex matching is case-insensitive and trims surrounding whitespace.

---

## Stage 2: Claude Haiku (cheap, only when Regex fails)

Called only when Stage 1 returns no match.

### Model
- `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — cheapest, fastest
- System prompt is small and prompt-cached → near-zero cost on repeated calls
- Max tokens: 256 (JSON response only, no prose)

### System Prompt (cached)

```
You are an intent classifier for a coding agent bot called Agent Smith.
Extract the user's intent from their message and return ONLY a JSON object.

Valid commandTypes: fix, list, create, help, unknown

Rules:
- "fix", "implement", "solve", "work on", "handle" → commandType: "fix"
- "list", "show", "what tickets", "open issues" → commandType: "list"
- "create", "add", "new ticket", "open a ticket" → commandType: "create"
- Greetings, capability questions → commandType: "help"
- Anything else → commandType: "unknown"
- Extract ticket numbers from #N or "ticket N" or "issue N"
- Extract project names after "in" or "for" or "on"
- If uncertain, set confidence: "low"

Always respond with valid JSON only. No explanation. No markdown.
Schema: { "commandType": string, "ticketNumber": string, "project": string, "title": string, "confidence": string }
```

### Behaviour on `confidence: low`

The Dispatcher asks the user for clarification before proceeding:
```
🤔 I think you want to [fix ticket #58], but I'm not sure.
Did you mean that? [Yes ✅] [No, show help 📋]
```

---

## Stage 3: Project Resolution (deterministic, no AI)

Runs after Stage 1 or 2 when `project` is empty string.

### Algorithm

```
1. Load all projects from agentsmith.yml
2. If only ONE project configured → use it directly (no lookup needed)
3. If multiple projects:
   a. Query each project's ticket provider for ticket #{ticketNumber} IN PARALLEL
   b. Collect results:
      - 0 matches → "Ticket #58 not found in any configured project"
      - 1 match   → use that project, proceed
      - 2+ matches → "Ticket #58 found in multiple projects: [a, b] — which one?"
                     User picks via Slack buttons
```

### Cost
Zero AI tokens. Pure API calls to ticket providers (Azure DevOps, GitHub, Jira, GitLab).
Parallel execution keeps latency low even with many projects.

### Edge Cases

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Ticket not found anywhere | Error message, no job spawned |
| Found in 1 project | Auto-resolved, proceed silently |
| Found in 2+ projects | Ask user to pick via buttons |
| Only 1 project configured | Skip lookup, use it directly |
| Ticket provider unreachable | Fail gracefully, report error |

---

## New Class: IntentEngine

Replaces `RegexIntentParser` and `ChatIntentParser` with a unified engine:

```csharp
public sealed class IntentEngine(
    IHaikuIntentParser haikuParser,
    IProjectResolver projectResolver,
    IConfigurationLoader configLoader,
    ILogger<IntentEngine> logger)
{
    public async Task<ResolvedIntent> ParseAsync(
        string input,
        string platform,
        string channelId,
        string userId,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

Returns a `ResolvedIntent` — a discriminated-union-style record:

```csharp
public abstract record ResolvedIntent;
public record FixIntent(string TicketNumber, string Project, string UserId, string ChannelId, string Platform) : ResolvedIntent;
public record ListIntent(string Project, string UserId, string ChannelId, string Platform) : ResolvedIntent;
public record CreateIntent(string Title, string Project, string UserId, string ChannelId, string Platform) : ResolvedIntent;
public record HelpIntent : ResolvedIntent;
public record ClarificationNeeded(string Suggestion, string OriginalInput) : ResolvedIntent;
public record UnknownIntent(string OriginalInput) : ResolvedIntent;
```

---

## Integration in Dispatcher

`IntentEngine` replaces the current `ChatIntentParser` in `Program.cs`.
The Dispatcher switch-cases on `ResolvedIntent` type:

```csharp
var intent = await intentEngine.ParseAsync(text, platform, channelId, userId, ct);

switch (intent)
{
    case FixIntent fix:        await HandleFixAsync(fix); break;
    case ListIntent list:      await HandleListAsync(list); break;
    case CreateIntent create:  await HandleCreateAsync(create); break;
    case HelpIntent:           await HandleHelpAsync(channelId); break;
    case ClarificationNeeded c: await HandleClarificationAsync(c, channelId); break;
    case UnknownIntent u:      await HandleUnknownAsync(u, channelId); break;
}
```

## Phase 20a Steps

| Step | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 20a-1 | `phase20a-regex-stage.md` | RegexIntentStage: pattern matching, ResolvedIntent records |
| 20a-2 | `phase20a-haiku-stage.md` | HaikuIntentParser: system prompt, JSON parsing, confidence |
| 20a-3 | `phase20a-project-resolver.md` | ProjectResolver: parallel ticket lookup, disambiguation |
| 20a-4 | `phase20a-intent-engine.md` | IntentEngine: orchestrates all three stages |
| 20a-5 | `phase20a-dispatcher-wiring.md` | Replace ChatIntentParser in Dispatcher Program.cs |

---

## Constraints & Notes

- Stage 2 (Haiku) is only called when Stage 1 fails — typical sessions cost near zero
- Project resolution queries ticket providers — ensure providers handle "not found" gracefully
- The old `RegexIntentParser` in `AgentSmith.Application` is kept for the CLI use case
- `IntentEngine` lives in `AgentSmith.Dispatcher` — it is chat-specific logic
- Token usage from Haiku calls is tracked in the existing `TokenUsageTracker`

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] "fix #58" resolves correctly (single project configured)
- [ ] "fix #58" with multiple projects triggers parallel lookup
- [ ] "fix ticket #58 in agent-smith-test" skips lookup, uses given project
- [ ] "please fix the login bug, ticket 58" → Haiku parses correctly
- [ ] "what can you do?" → HelpIntent
- [ ] Ambiguous input with low confidence → clarification message with buttons
- [ ] Truly unknown input → UnknownIntent with helpful fallback message
- [ ] No AI call for standard "fix #N in project" input
- [ ] Token cost for Haiku calls is tracked and logged

---

## Dependencies

- Phase 20b (Help Command) can be implemented in parallel
- Phase 20c (Error UX) depends on the new ResolvedIntent types
- `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` model available via existing ClaudeAgentProvider infrastructure
- All ticket providers must implement a lightweight `TicketExistsAsync(ticketId)` or
  `GetTicketAsync` method (already exists via `FetchTicketHandler`)

---

# Phase 20a: Implementation Notes — Intent Engine

## What was built

A three-stage intent engine replacing the old `RegexIntentParser` + `ChatIntentParser`:

1. **ChatIntentParser** (regex stage) — pattern-matches common inputs at zero AI cost
2. **HaikuIntentParser** — calls Claude Haiku for free-form text that regex can't parse
3. **ProjectResolver** — deterministic project lookup via ticket provider APIs
4. **IntentEngine** — orchestrates all three stages into a single `ParseAsync` call

## Why

The old parser was fragile: it only handled exact regex patterns and failed silently on anything else. Users typing natural language ("please fix the login bug, ticket 58") got no response. The new engine gracefully degrades from free (regex) to cheap (Haiku) to deterministic (project lookup), ensuring every input gets a meaningful response.

## Key decisions

- **IntentEngine lives in AgentSmith.Dispatcher** — it is chat-specific logic, not core application logic. The CLI still uses the old `RegexIntentParser` in `AgentSmith.Application`.
- **ChatIntent hierarchy as discriminated union** — `abstract record ChatIntent` with subtypes (`FixTicketIntent`, `ListTicketsIntent`, `CreateTicketIntent`, `HelpIntent`, `GreetingIntent`, `ErrorIntent`, `ClarificationNeeded`). The dispatcher switch-cases on these.
- **Project resolver queries ticket providers in parallel** — if the user says "fix #58" without specifying a project, all configured providers are queried simultaneously. Single match = auto-resolve, multiple = ask user, none = error.
- **SlackMessageDispatcher** routes intents to dedicated handlers (`FixTicketIntentHandler`, `ListTicketsIntentHandler`, `CreateTicketIntentHandler`, `HelpHandler`).
